/**
 * This class implements a technical support system. It is the top level class 
 * in this project. The support system communicates via text input/output 
 * in the text terminal.
 * 
 * This class uses an object of class InputReader to read input from the user,
 * and an object of class Responder to generate responses. It contains a loop
 * that repeatedly reads input and generates output until the users wants to 
 * leave.

 * #24. Hashmap is a way to store data using pairs, keys and values
 * #26. size()
 * #28. the new value replaces the old one.
 * #29. both values are stored separately, since they have different keys.
 * #30. while using containskey()
 * #31. it return null
 * #32. you use keySet()
 * #34. both store things, but Arraylist lets you have duplicates while hashset doesnt.
 * #35. you can define it to splut by a specific character like split(",")
 * #36. to split a string with a tab you use split([ \\t]) , and for a colon it's simply split(":")
 * #37. HashSet doesn't have any order for the elements while Arraylist does.
 * #38. it outputs empty strings.
 * #39. class variables: everyone in the classs can use them, you can also use them without making an object. Class methods: you also dont need to make an object to use them,they are associated with the class rather than an instance of the class
